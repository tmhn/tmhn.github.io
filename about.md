Hi there, I'm Tom. I'm currently studying Computer Science at Sheffield Hallam University. For my Industrial Placement Year I had the pleasure of working at <a href="http://www.next.co.uk">Next</a> as a software developer. Which I loved! 

I am currently in my Final Year at University and enjoying putting into practice the principles and lessons I learnt from my placement year. Currently working on a React-Native iOS application for healthcare professionals.

<br/>
Things I love
<ul>
	<li>Bikes</li>
	<li>Coffee</li>
	<li>Cake</li>
	<li>Open Source</li>
</ul>
